# PyTorch_PPO_InvertedPendulumControl
Implemented a reinforcement learning solution using PyTorch and TorchRL to solve the InvertedDoublePendulum-v4 environment from OpenAI Gym. Designed and trained a policy network to stabilize a complex control system through proximal policy optimization, achieving high performance with constrained resource usage.
